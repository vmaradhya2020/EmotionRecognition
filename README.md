Here’s how you should present your Emotion Recognition project on your resume, now fully reflecting both your code and the accuracy metrics detailed in your attached introduction PDF and script:[1][2]

**Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning Networks (FER2013)**
*Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Plotly, MTCNN*

- Engineered and trained multiple deep learning models (ResNet, Hierarchical CNN Block, CBAM, Enhanced Spatial Attention) for facial emotion recognition on the FER2013 dataset, tackling both individual and group emotion classification.

- **Optimized ResNet pipeline:** Achieved strong category results (e.g., F1-score: Happy 0.79, Surprise 0.72, Neutral 0.53) and high intersection-over-union (IoU) for positive emotions (e.g., Happy 0.65, Surprise 0.57).[2][1]
  
- **Improved feature learning:** Implemented advanced attention modules (CBAM, ESA) to emphasize salient facial regions, utilized data normalization/augmentation, and benchmarked attention-based models against standard CNNs:
    - HCB: F1-score up to 0.84 on Happy, 0.76 on Surprise, 0.61 on Neutral
    - CBAM: Best F1-score 0.58 (Happy), 0.35 (Neutral)
    - ESA: Explored enhanced spatial focus, with additional GPU/memory considerations.
  
- Developed robust data pipelines: handled preprocessing, label encoding, and real-time face detection (MTCNN). Built Plotly dashboards for model explainability, including confusion matrices and per-class TP/FP/FN bar charts.

- Automated group emotion detection from images: Detected and annotated multiple faces per image, outputting per-class emotion counts for social and behavioral analysis.

- **Key results:** Achieved up to 0.84 F1-score on 'Happy' (HCB), 0.79 on 'Happy' (ResNet), and IoU up to 0.65 on 'Happy'. Demonstrated deep learning's power and limitations in real-world emotion classification.

**Tips for your resume section:**

| Model          | Best F1-Score (Class)        | Other Highlights                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ResNet         | 0.79 (Happy), 0.72 (Surprise)| IoU up to 0.65, overall robust performance    |
| HCB            | 0.84 (Happy), 0.76 (Surprise)| Strong balance across classes                 |
| CBAM           | 0.58 (Happy), 0.35 (Neutral) | Lower, limited epochs; demonstrates complexity|
| ESA            | *Experimental*               | Spatial focus, noted resource limits          |

- Emphasize the best-performing metrics and state the models (ResNet/HCB) for recruitment impact.
- Mention practical applications (“real-time group emotion annotation using face detection”).
- Optionally provide a one-line summary of your workflow and result visualization achievements.
- Add a public GitHub link if available for further credibility.

This will spotlight your technical depth, results focus, and ability to apply advanced deep learning in emotion recognition contexts.[1][2]
